Humans are like kids in the Universe, slowly growing familiar and waking up to our surroundings. These acts of realizing what we've been experiencing all along is called discovery. 

Let's examine seemingly disparate discoveries, and an equation to bind them all. This examination has a non-technical conclusion, I swear!S

First is electricity. Do you remember rubbing plastic ruler on hair and holding it to tiny pieces of paper attracts the paper? Or touching the door knobs sometimes causes electric shocks? Well the answer is electricity, and humans have been observing it's effects since 600 BC <sup>[1](https://www.universetoday.com/82402/who-discovered-electricity/)</sup>. Thomas Browne introduced the term Electricity, and Micheal Faraday "invented" ways to generating electric current without depending on being stuck by ligtening (credits to [Benjamin Franklin](https://www.universetoday.com/82402/who-discovered-electricity/)) here!

If planet Earth is your home or you've ever used speakers/ headsets to listen music or used any computer with storage, you've used a magnet. Magnetism again was discovered by ancient Greeks, who found that some materials attract other materials ([source](https://www.dowlingmagnets.com/blog/2016/who-discovered-the-very-first-magnet/)). William Gilbert is credited with creating the first magnet and also discovering that the Earth itself is magnetic. Oersted then demonstrated that electricity flowing through a wire could affect a magnetic compass nearby.

So, that seems cool, two forces that do not seem related at first can influence each other, but is the relation deeper than this?

Maxwell took a bold step and unified these 2 fields. He combines all the laws of Electricity and Magnetism to come up with 4 equations, that explain electricity and magnetism together (electromagentism). These equations describe how the electric and magnetic effects are caused by charges and current. Furthermore, they explains how light propagates, as an ELECTRO-MAGNETIC wave, without requiring a hypothetical ether medium! 

Well, what does this have to do with me you ask?

I've for long been interested in big data processing, machine learning, space exploration, psychology and building things. These fields have felt so unrelated, that I haven't been motivated to pursue any of them in depth, and have been forever struggling to find my passion. I've also frequently felt discouraged that passion is supposed to be one single topic, and that I'm just interesting in these topics, without any intention to pursue them in depth.

But then, as I took a small leap into astronomy, and started reading about the [SDSS catalog](https://www.sdss.org/dr16/), I realized the huge potential of software for cataloging and archiving data as well as processing massive amounts of data to gain information. I then found open-source packages like [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), that satisfy the yearn to build stuff, and also provide a platform to interact with experts in the fields of both astronomy and software development. This path is starting to look like a promising and grand unification of my interests. 

Let's see the avenues these resources open up in my journey of chasing my interests!
