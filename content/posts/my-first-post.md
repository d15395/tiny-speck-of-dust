## The Big Bang!

I have often found myself looking up at the sky and wondering the point of our measly existence in the grandest scale of universe. 

I was awestruck to truly understand the consequence of galaxies/ stars that are lightyears away from us.It seems really unimaginable that if such a star were to disappear today (in star's today), we would only observe that event after so many years, because light takes so long to travel!

It seems almost magical to me that a we could spectate a single event multiple times over the span of 20 years because of a gravitational lens that bends light.

I've mostly been observing the universe, like a poet, just drinking in the beauty of the night sky.

But this does not seem enough any more. Being an engineer at heart, I want to understand how we know so much about the universe. I want to understand how the science behind those beautiful colurful images of the nearest galaxies using telescopes. I want to understand how we measure the brightness, distance, chemical composition of stars that are so far away, that it's hard to see them with plain eyes.

I want to understand the simulations that enable us to understand the past and the fututre of the galaxies.

In many ways, this truly is a big bang for my personal exploration into space. The events before that do not matter, because time was reset at the big bang, and I'm in the 0<sup>th</sup> second after the big bang. 

Better start catching up on the 14 billion years that I've missed!
